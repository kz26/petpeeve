This is one of the student projects mentored by Dr. Kenji Suzuki of the University of Chicago, as part of the DePaul University [MedIX REU program](http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix/index.htm) for summer 2011. The code will be written primarily in C++ with the [ITK (Insight Toolkit)](http://www.itk.org) library. Some Python is used for other parts of the project.

Project members:
  * Kevin Zhang, University of Chicago
